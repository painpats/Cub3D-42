# Cub3D-42

`Cub3D` is the **second group project** of the common core at 42's school. My mate was **mafissie**.

This project is a 3D RayCasting engine inspired by classic first-person shooters. The goal was to create a 3D representation of a 2D map, allowing players to navigate the environment and experience basic game mechanics. 

This project enhances skills in graphics programming, mathematics and game development concepts.

## Objectives

- Implement a 3D rendering engine using RayCasting techniques.
- Develop player movement and interactions within a 2D map.
- Understand and manipulate textures, colors, and lighting.

## Features

- 3D rendering of a 2D map.
- Player movement and rotation.
- Texture mapping for walls and floors.
- Simple collision detection.
- Basic game mechanics.

## Installation

To use `Cub3D`, simply clone the repository and compile it:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Cub3D-42.git
   cd Cub3D-42
   ```

## Usage

Compile the project and run the game as followed:
  ```bash
  make
  ./cub3D [map_file.cub]
  ```

Replace `[map_file.cub]` by the path to a valid map file.

Use the following controls for navigation:
- `W`: Move forward
- `A`: Move left
- `S`: Move backward
- `D`: Move right
- `Arrow keys`: Rotate the view
